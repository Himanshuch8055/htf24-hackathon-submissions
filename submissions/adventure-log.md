## Project Title
Adventure Log


## Project Description    
Do you ever play tabletop RPGs? Do you ever want to keep track of your adventures? Do you want to share your adventures with your friends? 

The project I created is all of this and more. It's a web app that allows you to create a "Adventure Log" for your tabletop RPG group starting with a simple audio recording. 

The app will transcribe the audio and allow you to review the transcription and then transform that into a journal style document write from the hand of your character. 


## Inspiration behind the Project  

Recently I've start a campaign of D&D with some friends and my character is a mage with the intrest of writing a journal about their adventures. 

I've always thought it would be cool to have a digital version of this so I can share it with my friends and keep track of our adventures. 

So I took the Appwrite challenge to build this app and see if I can make it a reality.
