## Project Title
GitKnit

## Project Description
What have you built during the hackathon?

I have created a discord bot and a supporting website that allows developer tool discords to link their repositories to a particular discord forum channels and push threads from that channel to our supporting website

## Inspiration behind the Project
Finding answers to obscure questions is hard particularly when the developer tooling is new, Often solutions to these problems are foudn in their discord, these qna's aren't indexable on the web, I wanted to create a site where all these obscure questiosn are indexed on the web and are accessible.
