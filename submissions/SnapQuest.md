## Project Title
SnapQuest

## Project Description    
SnapQuest is an app where users can compete against other users to see who manages to finish a given challenge first and take an image or video of it. 
The challenges have various difficulties and can range from "picking a selfie with your favorite book" to "balance a water bottle" or "find animal-shaped balloons", SnapQuest combines traditional Social Media aspects with fast and fun challenges.
## Inspiration behind the Project  
I often have the problem when meeting with friends, that after some hours we get bored and don't know what to do. 
With the appwrite hackathon coming up, I looked for solutions on how I could use my programming skills to create a fun activity for friends. 
An unexpected bonus of the app is how it encourages users to rediscover their own hometowns. By hunting for specific spots or completing challenges in places they might usually overlook, people can explore familiar surroundings in a totally new way.

## Tech Stack    
The app was mainly built using dart/flutter to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
I also used Appwrite User Auth, File Storage and Databases
