## Project Title
HealthPlus 

## Project Description    
HealthPlus is a healthcare management system project which is designed for the clinic doctors and individuals to schedule and manage their appointments.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
It is designed because there are lot of softwares and tools for the big hospitals to manage their appointments but not for small local clinics and doctors . So here comes `HealthPlus` which is designed for small and local clinics where the doctors can view , schedule and cancel the appointments of the patients and on each update on their appointments , the patient will be notified on the messages which makes the entire appointment process easy to use and with simple and minimal design of the web app , It's easy to navigate and use the project.
