## Inspiration behind the Project

From my personal experience, the best ways to get jobs are by following three startegies that works 100% of the time. These strategies are:

- Building your skills
- Connecting with people(Building your connection)
- Building your reputation

These steps are really explanatory and these three concepts must be mastered so you can regarded when it comes to Job.

It is advisable that you build your skills and then connect with people and build your reputation as a good and knowledgeable person that can be trusted with Jobs and would deliver with satisfaction. You can do all at once and that's why we built Joblier.

Joblier aims to help you get the hang of these three concepts all at a time with the best user experience for everyone. Both the employers and people searching for Jobs.
