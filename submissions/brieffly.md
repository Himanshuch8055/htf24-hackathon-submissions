## Project Title
_What is the name of your project?_

- Brieffly

## Project Description    
_What have you built during the hackathon?_

- During the hackathon, I built Brieffly, an educational app aimed at simplifying complex study materials for competitive exams like IIT JEE by breaking down complicated formulas and theories into concise, easy-to-understand cards. Brieffly tackles a common problem faced by students – the overwhelming volume of information that they need to remember and understand during exam prep. Students often spend countless hours reviewing and revising, struggling to retain crucial information, which can be both mentally draining and time-consuming.

- Brieffly **generates multiple cards** for each chapter, with each card containing an important formula or concept. Every card summarises the concept in less than 60 words, and it categorises it based on difficulty (beginner, intermediate, hard,advanced). The frontend interacts with the backend, which uses the Gemini API to create these concise summaries and Appwrite DB for managing user data.

- Brieffly is designed to make revision sessions more efficient, giving students an effective tool for quick revision with a clear, accessible layout and efficient content delivery.


## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

During my preparation for competitive exams like KVPY and IIT JEE, I often felt overwhelmed by the sheer volume of material to memorize and understand. I wished for a tool that could condense complex topics into quick, easy summaries for efficient revision. That experience inspired me to create Brieffly – a solution to simplify study sessions and make it easier for students to retain essential information. By turning dense concepts into short, digestible cards, I hope Brieffly can give students the resource I always needed during my own journey.

## Tech Stack    
_How have you built this project? Mention the technologies/methods/platforms you used to build your project_

To build Brieffly, I used Next.js for both the frontend and backend, leveraging its full-stack capabilities to streamline the app's development. The frontend in Next.js creates an interactive, responsive interface, while the backend handles API routes and manages data flow. I integrated the Gemini API to generate concise summaries for complex concepts and formulas, while **Appwrite DB** stores and manages user data efficiently.
