## Project Title
BugBank

## Project Description
We made a project called BugBank, designed to simplify bug management for developers. With AI-generated summaries that offer quick insights, you can stay on top of critical issues effortlessly. Collaborate seamlessly with your team, track progress in real time, and enhance your workflowâ€”all in one intuitive platform.

We recognized that traditional methods often lead to confusion and inefficiency, hindering productivity. By integrating AI and user-friendly features, we aimed to create a solution that streamlines the bug management but also enhances collaborations.
