Orbit

## Project Description
_What have you built during the hackathon?_
A mobile app that empowers university students to find and approach other people who share similar interests. Ultimately helping each one of us create lifelong friendships/relationships. Users can, in real-time see a list of other users who are also in the same area. Each user in the list has some information about them like their interests, what they are looking for, etc. Users can then request to meet up any user in that area. If the other user accepts the request, they would be taken to a chat screen where they can chat and decide where to meet or they can even share their precise location to easily find each other. Users can also set their status to "Open to meet" or "Not open to meet" to let other users know if they are looking for friends or not. They can configure certain times and areas where they are not open to meet.

## Inspiration behind the Project
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_
Despite the world being more connected than ever, we are currently facing a loneliness epidemic. I love building products that help people feel more connected with the people around them. I strive to negate the effects social media has on all of us (in mental health and face-to-face social interactions). I am nowÂ on a mission to empower every university student the ability to find and approach other people who share similar interests. Ultimately helping each one of us create lifelong friendships.

3 years ago, I was a freshman at the University of Calgary. Due to several visa problems, I arrived to university one semester late. As a result, when I first arrived, I struggled to make friends. In the dining hall, I would see people who seemed interesting, but I never had the courage to approach them. I always thought to myself, "What if they don't want to talk to me?" or "What if they think I'm weird?" I always wished there was a way to know if they:
- were open to talking to me
- shared similar interests as me
- were looking for friends too

All these and several other excuses stopped me from forming friendships with people who could have been my best friend.
3 years later, I have (mostly) overcomed my fear of approaching strangers. Now, every time I go to the dining hall, I see people who seem to face the same problem as I used to. They would sit alone and just look around hoping someone would approach them and have lunch with them. I decided to approach these people and several others who were sitting alone. Tried to get an understanding of what stops them and what they really need. I found out that most of them were just like me.

This is why I decided to build Orbit.
