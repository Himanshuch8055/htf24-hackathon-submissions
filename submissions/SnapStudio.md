## Project Title

**SnapStudio**

## Project Description    

SnapStudio makes it easy for anyone to create custom images of themselves without needing a new photoshoot every time. Just upload a few of your own photos, and SnapStudio’s AI generates new images with different styles, settings, and backgrounds—whether you need a fresh social media profile picture, an updated professional look, or something unique for your personal brand. With SnapStudio, you’re in control of your own photo library, with creative options at your fingertips.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

We were inspired by the work of twitter user and indie hacker @levelsio and his tool photoai, which makes custom photos accessible and fun to create. Seeing how powerful this concept was, we aimed to build a tool that makes it just as easy to create high-quality, creative images but with a focus on user-friendliness and flexibility. SnapStudio empowers anyone to express themselves in new ways.

## Tech Stack    


The technologies we used...

- **Frontend**: Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend Server**: Developed using Node.js and Express, the backend handles requests, manages data processing, and communicates with the AI model for image generation.
-**Appwrite**: We use Appwrite for backend services including user authentication, Database and Storage buckets.
- **Machine Learning**: SnapStudio leverages the **Black Forest lab's latest FLUX 1.1** model for its powerful image generation capabilities, enabling realistic and diverse photo outputs based on user input.
- **Cloud Services**: We chose **Azure** for VM deployment to host and scale our application.
