## Project Title
_What is the name of your project?_

Invicollab

## Project Description    
_What have you built during the hackathon?_

Our platform transforms the traditional invitation & wishes experience by enabling users to create interactive, 
personalized video-based wishes as well as animated invitations. You can form groups and create a custom video for a friend on their birthday.
Apart from this you can create & share invites to your friends/family for any occasion you are looking to celebrate just by selecting
what you'd like and copying the link to the experience we provide for you.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

The heart of InviCollab is about making it easy to gather loved ones for life’s meaningful moments.
The platform itself can feel like a “virtual gathering space” where users come together, creating the warmth of shared memories,
especially with the collaborative video feature. Invitations as well are often boring & don't provide any real experience, we wanted to change that.

## Anything else you want to share with us
We look to get this to multiple users in the near future. Expand with multiple templates wherein people can also share their own creations.
Monetize the platform as well (ideally for the videos feature). Lastly for the Invitations we are going to let people customize it more to
their preference & be a part of how the end result will look like.
