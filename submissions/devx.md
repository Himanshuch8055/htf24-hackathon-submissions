## Project Description    
DevX is a blogging application, where a user can register/login using email and password, or login through magic link  and read blogs written by other devs. User can write a blog and can publish. A user can read blog of others and can CREATE, READ, DELETE, UPDATE his own written blogs. This project uses Appwrite as backend and database services for handling authentication, asset storage etc.  This project has developed under the appwrite hackathon by @ankit-0369 with future plans of integrating real time user connection, implementation of community management routes in the application.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
DevX is a platform for developers. I inspired from other blogging platforms and thought of developing a platform where devs can share their knowledge and can engage in a community of same minds and can learn and teach others also.


## Tech Stack    
- **React.js** for the frontend, providing a fast and seamless user experience.
- **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive design.
- **Appwrite** as the backend for user authentication, database management, and secure data storage.
- **Redux Toolkit** for better state management of the application and control over the themes.
