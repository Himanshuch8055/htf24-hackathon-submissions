# Hackathon Submission: FeedbackSO

## Project Title
FeedbackSO

## Project Description    
FeedbackSO is a single feedback management platform for managing feedbacks. We can easily create pages and share it other people to get
their feedbacks. We can also import posts as feedbacks from social media and can share and import the results in our app
or we can share them directly. 
We can also integrate them to other systems like wix, html pages, wordpress, next app, react app, svelte app, etc with our widget system.
Customisable widgets plus endpoints for total customisation

## Inspiration behind the Project  
I created one SaaS pickpalette and tried to build a robust feedback system. And again while building another app, I again rebuild that. And 
mostly it is a tedious and mudane work and it takes time. So why not building a single platform for managing them only time and just integrate
it with other projects.

## Tech Stack    
Next js , appwrite, trigger dot dev and vercel.
I used next js as my Backend for frontend and also the api layer.
Use of appwrite - 
1. Database and remote configs.
2. Event driven queues. With appwrite I just have to connect events to the db and on data change and just have to trigger the actions.
Mainly for scraping.
3. For primary authentication.
4. Building the SSO wrapper for widgets along with the next js api routes and appwrite oauth
5. Functions for actions

I used trigger dot dev for twitter scraping using browsers which is not supported in appwrite functions

I used react js and next js api routes for building the widget system.
