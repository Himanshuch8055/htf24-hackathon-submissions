  Means-HF

## Project Description    
Means-hf is a powerful learning tool that helps users improve their English vocabulary while watching YouTube videos. Built for the Appwrite Hackathon, this project combines a browser extension with a web application to create an seamless learning experience.


## Inspiration behind the Project  
One day, I was watching a YouTube video and struggled to understand a few words; naturally, I donâ€™t know every word in English. Around that time, I was also learning web development, which inspired me to create a platform that could track my YouTube history (with my consent) and allow me to extract and understand words and meanings from videos. I also thought this could work as a note-taking app, using YouTube content as a source. Once I started building it, I carefully chose my tech stack and made slow progress until I learned about this hackathon. That gave me the motivation to speed up the project, so I focused on the essential feature of extracting words and meanings.

## Tech Stack    
Here is tech used in project
- **Frontend**: Built with Next.js.
- **Authentication**: Appwrite's Auth for secure user authentication.
- **Browser Extension**: Built with plasmo framework and it tracks video history on YouTube and sends selected videos to the primary backend.
- **Backend Server**: 
  - Api server(BE1)
  it uses bull mq for queue
  - Worker
  it picks up task from queue


### Usage of Appwrite
- Appwrite Auth

I used Appwrite Auth to secure my next app 
it is also used in backend server and worker
