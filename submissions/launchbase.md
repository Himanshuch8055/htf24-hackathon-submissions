## Project Description    
_What have you built during the hackathon?_

Launch Base is a ready-to-use starter template that helps you kickstart your SaaS app quickly. Itâ€™s built with Appwrite as the backend to handle all core operations like authentication, database, and storage, so you can focus on building features without worrying about the setup. Perfect for getting your SaaS idea off the ground fast!

## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

Launch Base came from seeing developers spend too much time on repetitive setup tasks like authentication, databases, and storage instead of focusing on their core ideas. I built it to provide a solid, ready-to-use foundation with Appwrite, allowing developers to skip the basics and start building faster. The goal is simple: help others launch their SaaS projects quickly and efficiently.
