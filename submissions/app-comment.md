## Anything Else You Want To Share With Us?
### Project Goal
The eventual goal of this project is to add comment section in your blogs / project with as little hassle as possible using appwrite.  

such that you just install this as
```bash
npm i app-comment
```
then in your layout project
```jsx
// layout.jsx
import CommentSection from "app-comment"
.... your code
<CommentSection postId={slug-of-your-post}>
```
This pkg is available on npm but it has error when importing  
you can check the main branch for npm pkg code
[or check app-comment on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/app-comment)  

---

To make onboarding more easy i'm also developing a cli-app that will help users to integrate app-comment easily in their existing project   
e.g :
```bash
npm @app-comment/cli
```
this will ask bunch of questions and then integrate app-comment in the existing project
