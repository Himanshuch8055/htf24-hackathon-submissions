## Project Title
**Wisdom: Your Notes Visualized through Knowledge Graphs**

## Project Description    
Wisdoma is a cutting-edge note-taking application designed to enhance your learning journey through exceptional organisation and visualisation solutions. With Wisdoma, you can visualise your notes using intuitive Knowledge Graphs, radial layouts, and simple tree structures, transforming the way you interact with your notes. Whether you prefer quick, messy notes or a meticulously organised system, Wisdoma scales with your workflow, providing a flexible environment that adapts to your unique note-taking style. Experience the power of interconnectedness and clarity in your notes like never before.

### Key Features

1. Knowledge Graphs for Enhanced Connectivity: Visualize your notes and folders through Knowledge Graphs, which illustrate the relationships within your content. With advanced visualisation options like intuitive graphs, radial layouts, and tree structures, you can effortlessly explore interconnected ideas and information. This dynamic feature enhances your understanding and retention by allowing you to see connections at a glance, making it easy to locate key information, recognise patterns, and derive insights from your entire note collection.

2. Powerful WYSIWYG Editor: A user-friendly text editor that simplifies formatting, catering to all users from students to professionals, making note-taking intuitive and enjoyable.

3. Intuitive File and Folder Organization: Wisdoma employs a structured folder system that helps you categorize and store your notes effectively. This organization keeps related content grouped, making it easy to retrieve and reference notes as your collection grows.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
I’ve always loved taking notes, but they often got buried across multiple documents, leaving me with scattered information and no cohesive way to bring them all together. I couldn’t find a solution that let me quickly jot down ideas while also supporting more structured, interconnected notes that I could easily reference and build upon.

Wisdoma was born from this need. It is a flexible platform where notes aren’t isolated bits of information but parts of a cohesive, evolving system. With Wisdoma, I wanted to create an experience that would make it simple to organize, connect, and visualize my notes in a way that’s both intuitive and powerful.

## Tech Stack    
Technologies Used:

Frontend: **React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS**

Backend and BaaS: **Appwrite**

### Usage of Appwrite

1. Appwrite Auth: Used it to authenticate and authorise users of Wisdoma

2. Appwrite DB: Used to store notes and folders as securely and elegantly as possible

3. Appwrite Storage: Store images and videos in your notes to make your notes more informative

### How Appwrite Helped Build This App Quickly

1. Authentication: Appwrite’s built-in auth service integrated seamlessly in my app. Plus, the fact that Appwrite’s features like DB and Storage operate within its Authorization layer makes it an extremely secure solution.

2. Structured Database Collections: Appwrite’s collection setup proved invaluable for supporting Wisdoma’s requirements. Appwrite’s schema made data reliable and removed the burden of client-side validations, resulting in a robust, dependable database.

3. Efficient SDK and API: Appwrite’s SDK is intuitive, with a minimal learning curve, making it incredibly efficient to implement in Wisdoma and saving valuable development time.

4. Secure Media Storage: As a media-rich notes app, Wisdoma needed reliable storage for images and videos, which Appwrite’s secure file storage provided seamlessly. The built-in security layer makes storing media a safe experience, offering users a product they can trust
