## Project Title
_What is the name of your project?_

Rroist

## Project Description    
_What have you built during the hackathon?_

A dynamic form-building platform that enables users to design and host customizable forms with ease. Users can personalize their forms by choosing from various backgrounds or gradients and have full control over form fields, including reordering and adding validations. Once designed, forms can be hosted on our domain to collect responses, with responses visible through a dedicated dashboard. Additionally, users can export their forms as React components using our CLI tool, enabling seamless integration into any codebase, similar to shadcn's approach. This project simplifies form management and expands flexibility for developers and users alike.


## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

The inspiration for this project came from the need for a streamlined, flexible solution to create and manage forms without the repetitive and time-consuming setup most developers face. Traditional form builders often lack customization options, making it difficult to fully align with branding or user experience requirements, and integrating these forms into existing projects usually requires additional code and maintenance.

Our platform addresses these pain points by offering a fully customizable form-building experience with a rich selection of backgrounds and gradients, reorderable and editable fields, and built-in validation. Beyond form creation, we provide a hosted domain to collect responses with ease, all managed through an intuitive dashboard. This approach eliminates the need for separate tools or plugins for form creation, hosting, and response handling, offering a one-stop solution.

A significant highlight of our project is the CLI tool that exports the form as a React component, which developers can integrate directly into their codebase. Inspired by tools like shadcn, this CLI enables developers to add complete form code into their projects with a single command, significantly speeding up the development process. This not only boosts productivity but also ensures consistency and modularity, making it a game changer for developers who want to quickly deploy forms without sacrificing customization.

Currently in beta, this project will continue to evolve, with future updates and features that enhance the experience for both developers and end-users. Weâ€™re committed to making form management simpler, faster, and more adaptable to real-world needs.

## Future Scope
The future scope of this project is expansive, with a roadmap aimed at enhancing functionality and user experience. Planned updates include:

- **Component Expansion**: We plan to introduce additional customizable components, like testimonial sections and other common UI elements, that can be seamlessly integrated with the form builder. Also plan to make a documentation section for the same for ease of use.
  
- **AI-Powered Insights**: By integrating AI capabilities, users will be able to analyze and summarize form responses, helping them derive actionable insights and saving time on data analysis.
  
- **Advanced Customization Options**: Further personalization features, such as custom animations, multi-step forms, and conditional logic, are in the works to increase flexibility and user engagement.
  
- **Enhanced Dashboard Analytics**: The dashboard will be upgraded to include more in-depth analytics, helping users track trends and response metrics with ease.

- **Enhanced Security**: Increase security and privacy features. Allow form makers to accept only one response per user.

These upcoming features will further establish our platform as a comprehensive, flexible tool that adapts to a wide range of use cases in form management and beyond.
