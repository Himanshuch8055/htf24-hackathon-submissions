Inspired by roadmap.sh, Devpath offers clear, structured roadmaps for roles like Fullstack and Frontend Developer. Each roadmap outlines essential skills and technologies, paired with free resources—articles, tutorials, and courses—handpicked to simplify learning. With Devpath, newcomers can follow a streamlined, step-by-step path to build confidence and succeed in their tech careers.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

The inspiration behind Devpath came from the need for a clear, accessible guide for beginners in tech. With so many learning resources available, it’s easy for newcomers to feel overwhelmed or unsure where to start. Platforms like roadmap.sh inspired us to create Devpath as a structured solution that not only outlines specific learning paths for roles like Fullstack or Frontend Developer but also pairs each step with quality, free resources. Our goal is to help aspiring developers confidently build foundational skills without the usual confusion, making tech careers more accessible to everyone.
